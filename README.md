### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am trying to get my head around Deep Learning, and in particular Deep Reinforcement Learning. Rather than taking the traditional route of reading high level consultant reports, I decided the only way to really understand it is to get my hands dirty and mess around with the underlying theory and code.

So far, I've played around with TensorFlow to build basic neural networks, Image Classification/Object Detection models, and transformer based models (using the HuggingFace models). More recently, I've been exploring ways to adapt TF Agents to work in real environments (as opposed to simulated ones).

I am also a dad, with two primary school aged children, and would love to be able to distill the complex ideas that underpin DL and RL into simple concepts that my (and other) kids can easily understand. 

I'm generally a curious person, so welcome any comments, ideas or questions.

Finally, I don't have a background in software development or IT (I work in a non-technical role at a bank), so apologies in advance if some of my contributions are a little bit unusual.
